# TradingApp

## Running the App
The trading app is currently used at an interface to trade using Alpaca keys. In order
to run the file load the file into ipython and run the function run_app(). The program
will bring up as sign in screen where you can enter your personalized keys.

This is the sign in screen:

This is what the trading platform looks like:

## Functions of the Platform
There are three segments that are used in the platform: Graph (Top Left), Trading (Top Right)
and Charts (Bottom). The graph can be manipulated and refreshed with the buttons and listboxes
below the chart. The Trading portion allows you to select what trading Algorithm to use.
and the chart is the individual stocks of the portfolio and statistics about it. It can also 
be refreshed.

## TODO
Import Upswing Method
Code up and import Moving Average Method
Code up and import Robinhood Method
Fix bugs in Graph Due to changes in APIs
